  Note, that we don't include Console Appender because all console info is written into catalina.out. This is harmful
  because that file gets bigger and bigger and if we don't keep an eye on it it will eat all disk space.
  Additional justification to not have console appender is that we have several apps that potentially can write into
  console and thus it can get messed up if all the logs for these apps are kept in a single file.

  There is a downside - you don't see app logs in your IDE when your start the app. This can be overcome, e.g. here is
  an instruction for IntelliJ: http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/webhelp/setting-log-options.html
  Eclipse/NetBeans gurus please put here a description on how your IDEs handle this.
