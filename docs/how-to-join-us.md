There are 2 ways you can help us:

# Send Pull Request

Here is a [list of issues](http://jira.jtalks.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&requestId=12902) you're welcome
to [send a Pull Request](https://github.com/jtalks-org) for. In this list we tried to gather tasks that are most
probably pretty local and require a small number of files to be changed. It doesn't always mean that the task is easy,
it just means it's easy for us to review your change. Feel free to choose this type of contribution if you don't want
to commit yourself to team work, but still want to help.
